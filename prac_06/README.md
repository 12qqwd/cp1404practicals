CP1404 Practical Reflection
Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each ... with your meaningful answer.

What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
  
I’ve started breaking tasks into smaller, 
manageable steps instead of trying to complete them all at once. This has helped reduce stress and improve the quality of my work. I’ve also begun using version control (Git) more consistently to track changes and avoid losing progress.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management by setting stricter deadlines for myself instead of relying on last-minute efforts. Additionally, I should ask for help sooner when stuck rather than spending too much time trying to figure things out alone.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been actively engaging with practical exercises and applying feedback from previous assignments. I’ll continue testing code incrementally and documenting my thought process to reinforce learning.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on starting assignments and avoid skipping planning phases (like pseudocode or flowcharts). Rushing into coding without a clear plan has led to avoidable mistakes.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I’d suggest more structured peer code reviews or collaborative projects to improve teamwork skills and expose students to different problem-solving approaches. Additionally, integrating real-world case studies could help bridge theory and practical application.
