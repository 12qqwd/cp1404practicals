# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404


Estimates

How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At the beginning of the subject, my estimate accuracy was often quite poor. I either underestimated the time required for understanding the task requirements or overestimated how quickly I could complete the implementation. Most tasks ended up taking longer than I initially expected.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, as I became more familiar with the structure of the practicals and more confident with Python and object-oriented programming, my estimates became more realistic. I learned to account for time spent debugging, reviewing instructions, and writing test code. This led to improved planning and less last-minute work.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Estimating task durations helped me break down complex problems into manageable steps and made me more aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I also learned the importance of buffer time and the need for flexibility when things don’t go according to plan.


Code Reviews

What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to value constructive feedback and understand that code reviews are not criticisms but opportunities for improvement. Other students or tutors often pointed out edge cases I hadn’t considered or suggested more Pythonic ways of writing my code. This improved both my technical skills and my mindset toward collaboration.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other people’s code helped me reinforce my own understanding of coding principles. I became more confident in identifying code smells, logic errors, and opportunities for improvement. It also taught me how to provide feedback clearly and respectfully, which is a valuable professional skill.

Good Code Review 1
PR Link: Review on Practical 07 - Project Class _**[Implementationhttps://github.com/12qqwd/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_07](https://github.com/12qqwd/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_07)_**

Explanation:
In this review, I gave feedback on the naming conventions and recommended more meaningful variable names, which enhanced readability. I also suggested simplifying a loop using list comprehensions, which made the code cleaner and more efficient.

Good Code Review 2
PR Link: Review on Practical 09 - Taxi _**[Simulatorhttps://github.com/12qqwd/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_09](https://github.com/12qqwd/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_09)**_

Explanation:
Here, I provided feedback about redundant code and encouraged reusing methods from the base class. I also identified a logic bug in the fare calculation that the author hadn’t noticed. My suggestions helped improve the maintainability of the program.


Practicals
Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge, I would add more short videos or visual guides for each prac to walk through key parts of the instructions. I would also include more real-world examples to make the purpose of each task clearer. Additionally, having a small peer-review requirement each week could help build teamwork and communication skills.

What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I consistently committed my work with clear messages and version control discipline. I also thoroughly tested my code and made sure to complete the optional extension tasks when possible. I kept my code well-structured, followed the style guide, and used good OOP practices like encapsulation and separation of concerns.
