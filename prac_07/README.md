# CP1404 Practical 07

## Project Overview

This is Practical 07 for the CP1404 Subject at James Cook University.  
It involves file reading and writing, classes and objects, CSV data processing, sorting and filtering, and building a menu-driven program.  
The project demonstrates how to use object-oriented programming to build practical tools while following Clean Code principles to improve code readability and maintainability.

## Key Clean Code Lessons Learned

- Break code into small, single-responsibility functions (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle)  
- Avoid duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), e.g., by reusing logic through helper functions  
- Use meaningful naming, such as `is_complete()` and `load_projects()`  
- Implement magic methods (like `__lt__`) to support sorting and improve code clarity  
- Write proper docstrings to describe the purpose and parameters of functions and classes
