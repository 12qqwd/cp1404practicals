# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
90%
I try to watch them each week on time. I missed a few due to assignment 
deadlines but always catch up later.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I usually watch them on Tuesday afternoons or Wednesday mornings, either in the 
library or in my dorm. Each session lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours. I take notes while watching to stay focused.
## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I've been proactive in completing the weekly practicals and submitting assignments
on time. I always double-check my work, and I plan to keep up this discipline and attention to detail.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
Sometimes I skip over parts I don’t fully understand, thinking I’ll come back later, but then I forget. I need to stop doing that and start researching or asking questions immediately when something is unclear.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I’m not very confident with version control (like Git), and my usage has been inconsistent. 
I plan to review the Git tutorials again and make a habit of using it properly in future tasks.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I write clean and readable code with good structure and helpful comments. 
This makes debugging and reviewing much easier, and I’m proud of this habit.
